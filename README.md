Raspberry-Pi–powered automated window control system

📌 Overview

This project is a Raspberry-Pi–powered automated window control system designed for a classroom environment.
It uses temperature, moisture, presence detection, and a democratic voting mechanism to decide whether to open or close windows. All events and errors are logged to InfluxDB.

🛠️ 1. Hardware Components

| Component             | Purpose                      | GPIO       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| Raspberry Pi          | Main controller              | —          |
| Grove Relay           | Opens/closes window          | 22         |
| JHD1802 LCD           | Displays system messages     | I²C        |
| DHT11 Sensor          | Measures indoor temperature  | 26         |
| Grove Moisture Sensor | Rain/soil moisture detection | A1 → CH4   |
| Presence buttons      | Student presence & voting    | 12, 16, 18 |
| Start button          | New session reset            | 6          |


🗄️ 2. InfluxDB Logging

Two measurement types are stored:

Environment & Voting

temperature

moisture

vote count

totalPresent

Error Logs

error message

full Python traceback

👥 3. Presence Management

Each student presses their assigned button to mark presence.

The START button clears presence and begins a new session.

LCD shows number of present students.

🌡️ 4. Environmental Monitoring

The loop continuously reads:

Temperature (DHT11)

Moisture level (rain detection)

Voting is triggered when:

Temperature > 25°C

Moisture < 50 (dry)

Window is closed

🗳️ 5. Voting System

When conditions require opening the window:

LCD displays: “Open windows? Press button”

Present students vote by pressing their presence button.

Vote duration: 15 seconds

If YES votes > 50% → window opens.

Cooldown prevents repeated votes after a NO result.

All results logged to InfluxDB.

🪟 6. Window Closing Logic

When the window is open:

If temperature < 24°C → close window

If moisture > 200 (rain detected) → close window

LCD messages indicate the reason.

⚠️ 7. Error Handling

Every exception creates an InfluxDB error entry containing:

the error message

the Python traceback

Safe shutdown ensures:

Relay off

LCD cleared

GPIO cleanup

🔄 8. Main Loop Summary

Runs every 1 second and executes:

Presence detection

Environmental measurement

Voting logic

Window opening/closing

Logging of all events

Complete autonomous operation

📝 10. Conclusion

This prototype combines environmental sensors, user interaction, and automated decision-making to manage classroom ventilation intelligently and safely. It enhances comfort, encourages engagement, and logs all system activity for analysis.
